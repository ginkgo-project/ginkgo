<a name="Mixed Precision Multigrid"></a>
@section SfTNrz This example shows how to use the mixed-precision multigrid solver.

In this example, we first read in a matrix from a file, then generate a
right-hand side and an initial guess. The multigrid solver can mix different precision of MultigridLevel. The example
features the generating time and runtime of the multigrid solver.
