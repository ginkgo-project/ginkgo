<h1>Using batched tridiagonal solver with data read from files</h1>
This example shows how to use Ginkgo batched tridiagonal solvers with data coming from
files. A specific directory structure is assumed; it should be general enough
for the use cases that Ginkgo batched functionality is intended for.

The size of all the matrices in the batch is assumed to be the same.
