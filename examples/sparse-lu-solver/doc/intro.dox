<h3> About the example </h3>
This example shows how to use incomplete factors generated via the ParILU 
algorithm to generate an incomplete factorization (ILU) preconditioner, how to
specify the sparse triangular solves in the ILU preconditioner application, and
how to generate an ILU-preconditioned solver and apply it to a specific problem.
