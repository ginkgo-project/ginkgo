<h1>This example shows how to use the iterative refinement solver.</h1>

<h3> In this example, we first read in a matrix from file, then generate a
right-hand side and an initial guess. An inaccurate CG solver is used as the
inner solver to an iterative refinement (IR) method which solves a linear
system. The example features the iteration count and runtime of the IR solver.
