<h1>Using batched solvers with data read from files</h1>
This example shows how to use Ginkgo batched solvers with data coming from
files. A specific directory structure is assumed; it should be general enough
for the use cases that Ginkgo batched functionality is intended for.

The sizes and sparsity pattern of all the matrices in the batch are assumed to
be the same.
