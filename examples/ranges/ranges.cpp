/*****************************<COMPILATION>***********************************
The easiest way to build the example solver is to use the script provided:
./build.sh <PATH_TO_GINKGO_BUILD_DIR>

Ginkgo should be compiled with `-DGINKGO_BUILD_REFERENCE=on` option.

Alternatively, you can setup the configuration manually:

Go to the <PATH_TO_GINKGO_BUILD_DIR> directory and copy the shared
libraries located in the following subdirectories:

    + core/
    + core/device_hooks/
    + reference/
    + omp/
    + cuda/

to this directory.

Then compile the file with the following command line:

c++ -std=c++11 -o ranges ranges.cpp -I../.. \
    -L. -lginkgo -lginkgo_reference -lginkgo_omp -lginkgo_cuda

(if ginkgo was built in debug mode, append 'd' to every library name)

Now you should be able to run the program using:

env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} ./ranges
