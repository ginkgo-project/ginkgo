@subsection EzvFDg About the example
This example showcases the usage of the Ginkgo solver CB-GMRES (Compressed
Basis GMRES). A small system is solved with two un-preconditioned CB-GMRES
solvers:
  1. without compressing the krylov basis; it uses double precision for
     both the matrix and the krylov basis, and
  2. with a compression of the krylov basis; it uses double precision for the
     matrix and all arithmetic operations, while using single precision for the
     storage of the krylov basis

Both solves are timed and the residual norm of each solution is computed to
show that both solutions are correct.
