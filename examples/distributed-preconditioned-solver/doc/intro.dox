<h1>Introduction</h1>
This distributed solver example should help you understand the basics of using Ginkgo in a distributed setting.
The example will solve a simple 1D Laplace equation where the system can be distributed row-wise to multiple processes.
To run the solver with multiple processes, use `mpirun -n NUM_PROCS ./distributed-solver [executor] [num_grid_points] [num_iterations]`.

If you are using GPU devices, please make sure that you run this example with at most as many processes as you have GPU
devices available.
