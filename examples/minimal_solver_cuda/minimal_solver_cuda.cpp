/*****************************<COMPILATION>***********************************
The easiest way to build the example solver is to use the script provided:
./build.sh <PATH_TO_GINKGO_BUILD_DIR>

Ginkgo should be compiled with `-DGINKGO_BUILD_REFERENCE=on` option.

Alternatively, you can setup the configuration manually:

Go to the <PATH_TO_GINKGO_BUILD_DIR> directory and copy the shared
libraries located in the following subdirectories:

    + core/
    + core/device_hooks/
    + reference/
    + omp/
    + cuda/

to this directory.

Then compile the file with the following command line:

c++ -std=c++11 -o minimal_solver_cuda minimal_solver_cuda.cpp -I../.. \
    -L. -lginkgo -lginkgo_reference -lginkgo_omp -lginkgo_cuda

(if ginkgo was built in debug mode, append 'd' to every library name)

Now you should be able to run the program using:

env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} ./minimal_solver_cuda

/*****************************<DECSRIPTION>***********************************
This is a minimal example that solves a system with Ginkgo. The matrix, right
hand side and initial guess are read from standard input, and the result is
written to standard output. The system matrix is stored in CSR format, and the
system solved using the CG method, preconditioned with the block-Jacobi
preconditioner. All computations are done on the GPU.

The easiest way to use the example data from the data/ folder is to concatenate
the matrix, the right hand side and the initial solution (in that exact order),
and pipe the result to the minimal_solver_cuda executable:

cat data/A.mtx data/b.mtx data/x0.mtx | ./minimal_solver_cuda
