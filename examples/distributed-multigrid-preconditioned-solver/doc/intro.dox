<h1>Introduction</h1>
This distributed multigrid preconditioned solver example should help you understand using Ginkgo multigrid in a distributed setting.
The example will solve a simple 1D Laplace equation where the system can be distributed row-wise to multiple processes.
Note. Because the stencil is configured equal weighted, the coarsening method does not perform well on this kind of problem.
To run the solver with multiple processes, use `mpirun -n NUM_PROCS ./distributed-solver [executor] [num_grid_points] [num_iterations]`.

If you are using GPU devices, please make sure that you run this example with at most as many processes as you have GPU
devices available.
