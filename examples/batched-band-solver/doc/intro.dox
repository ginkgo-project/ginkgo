<h1>Using batched band solver</h1>

This example shows how to use Ginkgo batched banded solvers with data coming from an
application. The "application" in this case is just a function in the example
itself; nevertheless, the steps to be taken are shown.

The size and the number of sub and super diagonals of all the matrices in the batch is assumed to be the same.
