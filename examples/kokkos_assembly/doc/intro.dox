<h1>Introduction</h1>
This example solves a 1D Poisson equation:

@f[
    u : [0, 1] \rightarrow R\\
    u'' = f\\
    u(0) = u0\\
    u(1) = u1
@f]

using a finite difference method on an equidistant grid with `K` discretization
points (`K` can be controlled with a command line parameter).

The resulting CSR matrix is assembled using Kokkos kernels.
This example show how to use Ginkgo data with Kokkos kernels.

<h3> Notes </h3>

If this example is built as part of Ginkgo, it is advised to configure Ginkgo with
`-DGINKGO_WITH_CCACHE=OFF` to prevent incompabilities with Kokkos' compiler wrapper
for `nvcc`.
