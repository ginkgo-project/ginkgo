<h1>Using batched solvers</h1>
This example shows how to use Ginkgo batched solvers with data coming from an
application. The "application" in this case is just a function in the example
itself; nevertheless, the steps to be taken are shown.

A `batch' here means a set of small linear systems that can be solved
independently, but each system is too small to use an entire computing device.
A requirement is that all the systems need to have the same sparsity pattern.
