<h1>This example shows how to use the mixed-precision multigrid solver.</h1>

<h3> In this example, we first read in a matrix from a file, then generate a
right-hand side and an initial guess. The multigrid solver can mix different precision of MultigridLevel. The example
features the generating time and runtime of the multigrid solver.</h3>
