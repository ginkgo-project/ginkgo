<a name="Multigrid Preconditioner"></a>
@section woSlWT This example shows how to use the multigrid preconditioner.

In this example, we first read in a matrix from a file. The preconditioned CG solver is enhanced
with a multigrid preconditioner. The example features the generating time and runtime of the CG solver.
