<h1>Introduction</h1>
This distributed spmv example should help you understand the basics of using Ginkgo in a distributed setting.
The example will read a matrix file and row-wise distribute the matrix to different processes
To run the spmv with multiple processes, use `mpirun -n NUM_PROCS ./distributed-spmv [executor] [file]`.

If you are using GPU devices, please make sure that you run this example with at most as many processes as you have GPU
devices available.
