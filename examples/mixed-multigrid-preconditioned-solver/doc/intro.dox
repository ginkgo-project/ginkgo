<h1>This example shows how to use the mixed-precision multigrid preconditioner.</h1>

<h3> In this example, we first read in a matrix from a file. The preconditioned CG solver is enhanced
with a mixed-precision multigrid preconditioner. The example features the generating time and runtime of the CG solver.</h3>
