<h1>Introduction</h1>
This example solves a 2D heat conduction equation

$
    u : [0, d]^2 \rightarrow R\\
    \partial_t u = \delta u + f
$

with Dirichlet boundary conditions and given initial condition and
constant-in-time source function f.

The partial differential equation (PDE) is solved with a finite difference
spatial discretization on an equidistant grid: For `n` grid points,
and grid distance $h = 1/n$ we write

$
    u_{i,j}' =
    \alpha\frac{u_{i-1,j}+u_{i+1,j}+u_{i,j-1}+u_{i,j+1}-4u_{i,j}}{h^2}+f_{i,j}
$

We then build an implicit Euler integrator by discretizing with time step $\tau$

$
    \frac{u_{i,j}^{k+1} - u_{i,j}^k}{\tau} =
    \alpha\frac{u_{i-1,j}^{k+1}+u_{i+1,j}^{k+1}
               -u_{i,j-1}^{k+1}-u_{i,j+1}^{k+1}+4u_{i,j}^{k+1}}{h^2}
    +f_{i,j}
$

and solve the resulting linear system for $ u_{\cdot}^{k+1}$ using Ginkgo's CG
solver preconditioned with an incomplete Cholesky factorization for each time
step, occasionally writing the resulting grid values into a video file using
OpenCV and a custom color mapping.

The intention of this example is to provide a mini-app showing matrix assembly,
vector initialization, solver setup and the use of Ginkgo in a more complex
setting.
