# The way rules work are explained in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules
# As a summary: Rules are evaluated when the pipeline is created, and evaluated
# in order until the first match. When a match is found, the job is either
# included or excluded from the pipeline, depending on the configuration.
