\subsection{Detailed Description}
A \hyperlink{classgko_1_1LinOpFactory}{Lin\+Op\+Factory} represents a higher order mapping which transforms one linear operator into another. 

In Ginkgo, every linear solver is viewed as a mapping. For example, given an s.\+p.\+d linear system $Ax = b$, the solution $x = A^{-1}b$ can be computed using the CG method. This algorithm can be represented in terms of linear operators and mappings between them as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A Cg\+::\+Factory is a higher order mapping which, given an input operator $A$, returns a new linear operator $A^{-1}$ stored in \char`\"{}\+C\+G
    format\char`\"{}
\item Storing the operator $A^{-1}$ in \char`\"{}\+C\+G format\char`\"{} means that the data structure used to store the operator is just a simple pointer to the original matrix $A$. The application $x = A^{-1}b$ of such an operator can then be implemented by solving the linear system $Ax = b$ using the CG method. This is achieved in code by having a special class for each of those \char`\"{}formats\char`\"{} (e.\+g. the \char`\"{}\+Cg\char`\"{} class defines such a format for the CG solver).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Another example of a \hyperlink{classgko_1_1LinOpFactory}{Lin\+Op\+Factory} is a preconditioner. A preconditioner for a linear operator $A$ is a linear operator $M^{-1}$, which approximates $A^{-1}$. In addition, it is stored in a way such that both the data of $M^{-1}$ is cheap to compute from $A$, and the operation $x = M^{-1}b$ can be computed quickly. These operators are useful to accelerate the convergence of Krylov solvers. Thus, a preconditioner also fits into the \hyperlink{classgko_1_1LinOpFactory}{Lin\+Op\+Factory} framework\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The factory maps a linear operator $A$ into a preconditioner $M^{-1}$ which is stored in suitable format (e.\+g. as a product of two factors in case of I\+LU preconditioners).
\item The resulting linear operator implements the application operation $x = M^{-1}b$ depending on the format the preconditioner is stored in (e.\+g. as two triangular solves in case of I\+LU)
