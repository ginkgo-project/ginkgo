/**
 * @page Examples Example programs
 *
 * Here you can find example programs that demonstrate the usage of Ginkgo.
 * Some examples are built on one another and some are stand-alone and
 * demonstrate a concept of
 * Ginkgo, which can be used in your own code.
 *
 * You can browse the available example programs
 * <ol>
 *   <li> as <b><a href="#graph">a graph</a></b> that shows how example programs
 *     build upon each other.
 *   <li> as <b><a href="#list">a list</a></b> that provides a short
 *     synopsis of each program.
 *   <li> or <b><a href="#topic">grouped by topic</a></b>.
 * </ol>
 *
 * By default, all Ginkgo examples are built using CMake.
 *
 * An example for building the examples and using Ginkgo as an external library
 * without CMake can be found in the script provided for each example, which
 * should be called with the form:
 * <code>./build.sh PATH_TO_GINKGO_BUILD_DIR </code>
 *
 * By default, Ginkgo is compiled with at least
 * <code>-DGINKGO_BUILD_REFERENCE=ON</code>.
 * To execute on a GPU, you need to have a GPU on the system and must have
 * compiled Ginkgo with the <code>-DGINKGO_BUILD_CUDA=ON</code> option.
