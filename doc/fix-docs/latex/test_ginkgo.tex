\subsection*{Testing Instructions }

\subsubsection*{Running the unit tests}

You need to compile ginkgo with {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+TS=ON} option to be able to run the tests.

\paragraph*{Using make test}

After configuring Ginkgo, use the following command inside the build folder to run all tests\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
make test
\end{DoxyCode}


The output should contain several lines of the form\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
    Start  1: path/to/test
1/13 Test  #1: path/to/test .............................   Passed    0.01 sec
\end{DoxyCode}


To run only a specific test and see more details results (e.\+g. if a test failed) run the following from the build folder\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./path/to/test
\end{DoxyCode}


where {\ttfamily path/to/test} is the path returned by {\ttfamily make test}.

\paragraph*{Using C\+Test}

The tests can also be ran through C\+Test from the command line, for example when in a configured build directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
ctest -T start -T build -T test -T submit
\end{DoxyCode}


Will start a new test campaign (usually in {\ttfamily Experimental} mode), build Ginkgo with the set configuration, run the tests and submit the results to our C\+Dash dashboard.

Another option is to use Ginkgo\textquotesingle{}s C\+Test script which is configured to build Ginkgo with default settings, runs the tests and submits the test to our C\+Dash dashboard automatically.

To run the script, use the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
ctest -S cmake/CTestScript.cmake
\end{DoxyCode}


The default settings are for our own CI system. Feel free to configure the script before launching it through variables or by directly changing its values. A documentation can be found in the script itself.
