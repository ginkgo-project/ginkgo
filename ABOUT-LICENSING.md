If you want to use Ginkgo, but need a different license, please
[contact us](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo/wiki#contact-us).

Ginkgo source distribution does not bundle any third-party software. However,
the licensing conditions of Ginkgo's dependencies still apply, depending on the
modules used with Ginkgo. Please refer to the documentation of the dependencies
for license conditions. Additionally, depending on the options used to compile
Ginkgo, the build system will pull additional dependencies which have their own
licensing conditions (note that all of these are extra utilities, and it is
possible to obtain a fully functional installation of Ginkgo without any of
them). They include the following:

When compiling Ginkgo with `-DBUILT_TEST=ON`, the build system will download and
build [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest), and link the binary
with Ginkgo's unit tests. Google Test is available under the following license:

When compiling Ginkgo with `-DGINKGO_DEVEL_TOOLS=ON` the build system will download
[git-cmake-format](https://github.com/kbenzie/git-cmake-format), available under
the following license:

When compiling Ginkgo with `-DGINKGO_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON` the build system will
download, build, and link [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags) and 
[RapidJSON](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) with the
benchmark suites. gtest is available under the following license:

RapidJSON is available under the following license (note that Ginkgo's build
system automatically removes the `bin/jsonchecker/` directory which is licensed
under the problematic JSON license):

> Tencent is pleased to support the open source community by making RapidJSON
> available.

> rights reserved.
> 
> If you have downloaded a copy of the RapidJSON binary from Tencent, please
> note that the RapidJSON binary is licensed under the MIT License.  If you have
> downloaded a copy of the RapidJSON source code from Tencent, please note that
> RapidJSON source code is licensed under the MIT License, except for the
> third-party components listed below which are subject to different license
> terms.  Your integration of RapidJSON into your own projects may require
> compliance with the MIT License, as well as the other licenses applicable to
> the third-party components included within RapidJSON. To avoid the problematic
> JSON license in your own projects, it's sufficient to exclude the
> bin/jsonchecker/ directory, as it's the only code under the JSON license.  A
> copy of the MIT License is included in this file.

__NOTE:__ Some of the options that pull additional software when compiling
Ginkgo are ON by default, and have to be disabled manually to prevent
third-party licensing. Refer to the [Installation section in
README.md](README.md#installation) for more details.
