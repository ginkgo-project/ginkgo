/**
 * ParICT is an incomplete threshold-based Cholesky factorization which is
 * computed in parallel.
 *
 * $L$ is a lower triangular matrix which approximates a given symmetric
 * positive definite matrix $A$ with $A \approx LL^T$. Here, $L$ has a sparsity
 * pattern that is improved iteratively based on its element-wise magnitude.
 * The initial sparsity pattern is chosen based on the lower triangle of $A$.
 *
 * One iteration of the ParICT algorithm consists of the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Calculating the residual $R = A - LL^T$
 * 2. Adding new non-zero locations from $R$ to $L$.
 *    The new non-zero locations are initialized based on the corresponding
 *    residual value.
 * 3. Executing a fixed-point iteration on $L$ according to
 * $
 * F(L) =
 * \begin{cases}
 *     \frac{1}{l_{jj}}
 *         \left(a_{ij}-\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}l_{ik}l_{jk}\right), \quad & i \neq j \\
 *     \sqrt{a_{ij}-\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}l_{ik}l_{jk}}, \quad & i = j \\
 * \end{cases}
 * $
 * 4. Removing the smallest entries (by magnitude) from $L$
 * 5. Executing a fixed-point iteration on the (now sparser) $L$
 *
 * This ParICT algorithm thus improves the sparsity pattern and the
 * approximation of $L$ simultaneously.
 *
 * The implementation follows the design of H. Anzt et al.,
 * ParILUT - A Parallel Threshold ILU for GPUs, 2019 IEEE International
 * Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), pp. 231â€“241.
