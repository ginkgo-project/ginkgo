###Summary:
Created solver file
core/solver/batch_idr.cpp
	This is where the batch_idr algorithm needs to be implemented.

Created class header
include/ginkgo/core/solver/batch_idr.hpp
	This is where the batch_idr class functions need to be implemented.

Created kernel header
core/solver/batch_idr_kernels.hpp
	This is where the algorithm-specific kernels need to be added.

Created Reference kernel file
reference/solver/batch_idr_kernels.cpp
	Reference kernels for batch_idr need to be implemented here.

Created OpenMP kernel file
omp/solver/batch_idr_kernels.cpp
	OMP kernels for batch_idr need to be implemented here.

Created CUDA kernel file
cuda/solver/batch_idr_*.[ch]*
	CUDA kernels for batch_idr need to be implemented here.

Created HIP kernel file
hip/solver/batch_idr_kernels.hip.cpp
	HIP kernels for batch_idr need to be implemented here.

Created DPC++ kernel file
dpcpp/solver/batch_idr_kernels.dp.cpp
	DPC++ kernels for batch_idr need to be implemented here.

Created unit tests for batch_idr solver
core/test/solver/batch_idr.cpp
	This is where core related unit tests should be implemented, i.e. relating to the interface without executor usage.

Created unit tests for batch_idr reference kernels
reference/test/solver/batch_idr_kernels.cpp
	This is where tests with the Reference executor should be implemented. Usually, this means comparing against previously known values.

Created unit tests for batch_idr OMP kernels
omp/test/solver/batch_idr_kernels.cpp
	This is where tests with the OpenMP executor should be implemented. Usually, this means comparing against a Reference execution.

Created unit tests for batch_idr CUDA kernels
cuda/test/solver/batch_idr_kernels.cpp
	This is where tests with the CUDA executor should be implemented. Usually, this means comparing against a Reference execution.

Created unit tests for batch_idr HIP kernels
hip/test/solver/batch_idr_kernels.*
	This is where tests with the HIP executor should be implemented. Usually, this means comparing against a Reference execution.

Created unit tests for batch_idr DPC++ kernels
dpcpp/test/solver/batch_idr_kernels.*
	This is where tests with the DPC++ executor should be implemented. Usually, this means comparing against a Reference execution.

### TODO:
In all of the previous files batch_gmres was automatically replaced into batch_idr. Ensure there is no inconsistency.

All the imported code was commented and TODO items were generated in the new files.
Check all the modified files for "// TODO (script:batch_idr):" items
e.g. by using  grep -nR "// TODO (script:batch_idr):" /home/isha/Desktop/MyFork/ginkgo/dev_tools/scripts/../.. | grep -v "create_new_algorithm.sh" | grep -v "todo_batch_idr.txt".
